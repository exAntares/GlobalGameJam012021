You are the last member of your crew. The last battles have left your ship in a deplorable state. You are now drifting through the sea, gathering everything you can find in order to survive the dangerous waters. Will you make it to a safe spot and earn something extra on the way?

 - Collect treasure
 - Collect pieces of ships
 - Protect your boat

We thank you for setting up the event and for joining us. The complexities of building a game in such a short time all in remote can make things even harder than a regular game jam. We are still very grateful for your contributions and hope to see you in more of these!
